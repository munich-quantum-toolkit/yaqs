## [Unreleased]

### End of support for x86 macOS systems

Starting with this release, we can no longer guarantee support for x86 macOS systems.
This comes as a result of GitHub removing the `macos-13` runners from their infrastructure.
x86 macOS systems are no longer tested in our CI and we can no longer guarantee that MQT YAQS installs and runs correctly on them.

### End of support for Python 3.9

Starting with this release, MQT YAQS no longer supports Python 3.9.
This is in line with the scheduled end of life of the version.
As a result, MQT YAQS is no longer tested under Python 3.9 and requires Python 3.10 or later.
